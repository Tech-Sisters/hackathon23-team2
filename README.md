  <h2>
    üßê The Idea
  </h2>
  <p>
    A product that will be of benefit to the muslim community, focusing on Qur'an memorisation and a female audience.
  <p>
  <h2>
    üßê The Solution
  </h2>
  <p>
  An application where users can:
    <ul>
      <li>Complete daily tests with a focus on their weaker Surahs.</li>
      <li>Take initiative and engage in their own self-initialised tests.</li>
      <li>Get personalised reports and insights of their Qur'an hustory.</li>
      <li>Be part of a community of like-minded Muslim women who are actively engaging in strengthening their memorisation.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  <h2>
    üßê The Prototype
  </h2>
  <p>

# Instruction to the team:

## When working on the project's frontend or backend:

Navigate to the frontend or backend directory.

For example, if working on the frontend:

`cd frontend-react`
`npm install`
`npm start`

If working on the backend, you can use the command `npm run dev`
to automatically reload the server after .js file changes.

## When running Git commands:

Ensure you're at the root directory of the project to execute Git commands. This step is crucial as Git operates based on the current directory.
