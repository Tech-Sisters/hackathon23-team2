# Instruction to the team:

## When working on the project's frontend or backend:

Navigate to the frontend or backend directory.

For example, if working on the frontend:

``cd frontend-react``
``npm start``

## When running Git commands:

Ensure you're at the root directory of the project to execute Git commands. This step is crucial as Git operates based on the current directory.
