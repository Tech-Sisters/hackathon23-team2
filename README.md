  <h2>
    üßê The Idea
  </h2>
  <p>
    A product that will be of benefit to the muslim community, focusing on Qur'an memorisation and a female audience.
  <p>
  <h2>
    üßê The Solution
  </h2>
  <p>
  We wanted to create an application that helped users to track their Qur'an memorisation, 
   and provided insights to their  progress. This application is needed so that users can take 
    accountability for their memorisation and view their weak points. 
  It was important for the UI to be smooth and easy to use, and for users to be prompted to test their weaker surahs.
  <br/>
   <br/>
  Bearing in mind our criteria, we defined the following features:
      <ul>
      <li>Complete daily tests with a focus on their weaker Surahs.</li>
      <li>Take initiative and engage in their own self-initialised tests.</li>
      <li>Get personalised reports and insights of their Qur'an hustory.</li>
      <li>Be part of a community of like-minded Muslim women who are actively engaging in strengthening their memorisation.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  <h2>
    üßê The Prototype
  </h2>
  <p>
  The prototype has been built and designed as a mobile-first fullstack web application, as this would make the transition to a mobile app much smoother.
<br/>
     <br/>
The below diagram provides an overview of the architectural design for our prototype. 
We made the decision to use Firebase for efficient user authentication, and React on the frontend for it's ability to create reusable components which make up much of the UI.

From this flow, we implemented the core functionality which is illustrated by this simplified diagram:

## üèÅ Get up and running:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites:
You will need access to the database from the team if working with the a local backend.

### Installing:
Navigate to the frontend or backend directory.

For example, if working on the frontend:

1. `cd frontend-react` <br/>
2. `npm install` <br/>
3. `npm start`
<br/>
If working on the backend, you can use the command `npm run dev` to work with the development environment. 
<br/>
<strong>note: </strong>

### When running Git commands:

Ensure you're at the root directory of the project to execute Git commands. This step is crucial as Git operates based on the current directory.
