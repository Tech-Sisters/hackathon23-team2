# Instruction to the team:

## When working on the project's frontend or backend:

Navigate to the frontend or backend directory.

For example, if working on the frontend:

`cd frontend-react`
`npm install`
`npm start`

If working on the backend, you can use the command `npm run dev`
to automatically reload the server after .js file changes.

## When running Git commands:

Ensure you're at the root directory of the project to execute Git commands. This step is crucial as Git operates based on the current directory.
